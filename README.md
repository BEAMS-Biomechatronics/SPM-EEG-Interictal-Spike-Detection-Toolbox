# SPM EEG Interictal Spike Detection Toolbox

***This code is for research purposes only.***

SpikeDet, an SPM EEG Spike detection toolbox, allows detecting spikes in an EEG record by using a fully automated method described in [Nonclercq2012] and based on [Nonclercq2009]:
We propose a fully automated method of interictal spike detection that adapts to interpatient and intrapatient variation in spike morphology. The algorithm works in five steps. (1) Spikes are detected using parameters suitable for highly sensitive detection. (2) Detected spikes are separated into clusters. (3) The number of clusters is automatically adjusted. (4) Centroids are used as templates for more specific spike detections, therefore adapting to the types of spike morphology. (5) Detected spikes are summed.
